    History of Salsa Dancing

   <p>
        Salsa dancing hails from the traditions of multiple cultures and is
        popular throughout the world. The use of the word salsa originates from
        a 1933 song by composer Ignacio Pinerio.There are several different
        salsa types influenced by cultural mix of the cities that they
        originated. For example, most famous in North America are New York Salsa
        (also called dancing 'On 2') and Los Angeles Salsa (known as dance 'On
        1â€™).Salsa dancing is always excellent entertainment. It also helps in building a lot of energy and hence is a
        good way to
        start your day. You may learn salsa dancing in the privacy of your house or in a studio, with or without a
        partner.

<!---Added h5, included a sub title and an unordered list recommendations for someone new to the activity.-->

<h5>Recommendations</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Take classes. Nothing beats a one-on-one lesson with an instructor. </li>
    <li>Practice. Attend salsa dsncing socials and practice what you did in class. They're affordable and loads of fun.
    </li>
    <li>Attend salsa festivals if you can. You get to learn from other instructors, dance with other dancers and gauge
        you level.</li>
    <li>Perform. Sounds intimidating but this is the key to breaking the intermediate level plateau.</li>
